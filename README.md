# ClearClipboard
20170403

Android Studio Project
Uses Xposed Framework

Clears the clipboard history when an empty string is copied. Samsung  introduced a ClipBoard history of 20 items, your average password manager will attempt to remove  a password by copying an empty string, that will not work in this case. There are similar modules  out there but they did not work for me. This module will copy 20 texts to push out the password.  It's my first module and even has a Toast message. What more could you wish for?
